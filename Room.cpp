#include "Room.h"
//TODO:
// 
//move the '_fields field' here
//move the room's size and other room features...
// 
//rooms features
//Xsize
//Ysize
//array of contents
//how many symbols are used in the map 
//(implement a symbol meaning
//that its the end of the map)
//so the game wont print things out of scope
//  
//you can later implement the rooms with a list
//so that each room leads to a next one
// 
//wonder what should save information
//about players position, the game object
//or the room object or is it redundant
//to save it otherwhere rather than in the player object somewhere???
